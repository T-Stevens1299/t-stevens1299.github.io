## This is the repository that I use to host my online portfolio site, www.thomasstevens.xyz

I'm Thomas Stevens, a third-year Computer Games Design and Programming student at Staffordshire University. With A-levels in Computer Science, Maths, and Geography, I have a strong foundation in technical subjects.

Over the past three years, I've immersed myself in industry-standard languages like C# and C++, while gaining hands-on experience with the Unreal and Unity game engines. Although I appreciate the creative aspects of game design, my primary focus lies in programming and developing a successful career in this field.

My placement year at a games development studio was invaluable. I contributed to various projects, honed my programming skills, and even led a small team, effectively bridging communication between the team and management. This experience significantly enhanced both my technical abilities and interpersonal skills.

I'm eager to discuss potential projects or answer any questions you may have. Feel free to reach out - I'm always happy to help.
