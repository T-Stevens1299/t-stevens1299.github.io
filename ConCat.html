			  <h5>Overview</h5>
              <p>
              Construction Catastrophe is a group project I partook in during my second year of university.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
              My role was a Junior programmer and the team had 22 members. Only 4 of which were programmers, so I had more responsibilites than anticipated.
              </p>
              <p>
              I worked on the project for the entirety of its development, which was a short time frame of only 6 weeks.

			<h5>Contributions</h5>
              <p>
              Chaos Destruction System: </p>
			  <p>One of the main mechanics of this game was breakable building blocks. In order to achieve this I utilised Unreal Engine 5's Chaos Destruction system. This allows you to take a static mesh and break it into multiple pieces.</p>
			  <p>This system required multiple re-works throughout development however to improve performance. The finalised version worked by calling a geometry collection to spawn when a block was broken, then it immediately break into many pieces as the damage threshold values were 0.</p>		

				
			  <br>
			  <p>Tool System:</p>
			  <p>I was also tasked with programming the entire tool system, this included the tool classes themselves as well as pickups and damage/durability functions, as well as integrating them into the character class.</p>

						<p>This video shows the tool system and using them to break building pieces which utilise the chaos destruction plugin.</p>
					
				</details>
			  
			  <br>
			  <p>Action Profiles UI:</p>
			  <p>Since the game is local multiplayer with no split screen, the players would need a way to check their health and over vital information. Therefore we opted for player UI icons on the corner of each screen, to cater for up to 4 players.</p>
			  <p>These UI widgets would display the tool that they currently had as well as the health and player status image. This would show if the player had been damaged, stunned or dead. I had to implement these, and I did this by utilising the UI binding functions.</p>
			  
			  <br>	
			  <p>Meteor Disaster:</p>
			  <p>One of the main game mechanics was disasters that kill the players and destroy the structures they have built. I was tasked with creating the meteor shower. This also utilised the chaos destruction system as the design team wanted scattered meteor debris shards rather than just an explosion VFX.</p>

				
			  <br>
			  <p>Game Over Screens:</p>
			  <p>I was also tasked with creating the game win condition and game over screens to display the player rankings as well as their score. Which in this case is how long they were able to survive.</p>
