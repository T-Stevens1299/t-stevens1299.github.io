				<h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>As part of my module Multiplayer Level Design, I was tasked with creating a map for Team Fortress 2's King Of The Hill (KOTH) game mode. As part of the map development process we had to research game mechanics, exisitng levels, multiplayer level design techniques, as well as conduct play-testing to iterate our level designs.</p>
				<h2>Project Info</h2>
				<p>Role: Level Designer</p>
				<p>Team Size: 1</p>
				<p>Time Frame: 8 Weeks</p>
				<p>Engine: Hammer Editor</p>


                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                <p>For this project I had to develop a King of The Hill map for the game Team Fortress 2. To do this I had to research a vareity of exisiting and community maps, as well as research the techniques used when developing maps for the Hero Shooter genre.</p>
                <p>I also partcipated in 4 play-tests each consisting of a minimum of 10 people. These play-tests allowed feedback to be given on my maps, so the future iterations would be more balanced and enjoyable to play on.</p>
				<p>The final stage of the project was publishing my map on the Steam Workshop.</p>
				
				<h2>Map Inspiration</h2>
				<p>The inspiration behind the theming of this map was the New York Subway and London Underground. Therefore the areas of the map feel like a fusion between the two cities metro systems. I also chose to focus on the subway theme as I wanted a central hazard around the capture point to increase player risk when trying to capture/defend the point.</p>
			
				<h2>Project Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall I believe the project to be a success since in my final round of play-testing, which featured 15 particpants, the map recieved an average score of 4.55/5 and everyone who played the map enjoyed it. As well as this, there was little to no feedback suggesting further improvements.</p>
