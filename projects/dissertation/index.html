				<h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>As part of my final year studies, I am currently writing a dissertation. This paper titled: AI in Real-time Strategy Games: A Study on the development processes behind them, aims to explore how the games industry and researchers alike, tackle the issue of creating challenging AI opponents in RTS games.</p>
				
				<h2>Project Info</h2>
				<p>Role: Project developer and researcher</p>
				<p>Team Size: 1</p>
				<p>Time Frame: Ongoing development</p>
				<p>Engine & Language: Unreal with C++</p>


                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The AI opponents in real-time strategy aim to offer a challenge to human players when playing a match of an RTS game, however in most titles, even at the harder difficulties the AI still plays the same, they just tend to have a larger fighting force compared to the player. Resulting in the match feeling harder for the player, but not more challenging as they can use the same tactics as before.</p>
                <p>Therefore, paper intends to investigate the development processes utilised by the games industry and researchers respectively, to develop AI opponents that try to create a challenging game state for the human players they are pitted against.</p>
				<p>An RTS prototype will be developed in the Unreal 5 games engine, featuring a basic AI system to control the enemy faction a human player will play against. Four different techniques used by researchers and the games industry will then be injected into the AIâ€™s code, or into the game mode itself. These techniques will then be tested by getting participants to play a match against each of the different AI opponents, after each match they will fill in a questionnaire answering whether they beat the AI and how difficult they were. These results will then be used to judge if the technique used is an effective way of creating a more challenging AI opponent.</p>
				
				<h2>Current Project Progress</h2>
                <p>As of the end of December, the literature review and research methodology sections of the dissertation are completed. The core mechanics of the prototype are finished, the only development left to complete is developing the AI system itself.</p>
