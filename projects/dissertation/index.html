				<h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>As part of my final year studies, I am currently writing a dissertation. This paper titled: AI in Real-time Strategy Games: A Study on the development processes behind them, aims to explore how the games industry and researchers alike, tackle the issue of creating challenging AI opponents in RTS games.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Realtime strategy (RTS) games are a sub-genre of strategy games which are characterised by the fact that all decisions and movements happen in real-time, unlike their turn-based counterparts. Calculating many decisions at runtime however can make it difficult to engineer challenging AI. Therefore, this paper investigated the different techniques and development processes used by the games industry and academia, to determine which ones are the most optimal for creating more challenging AI opponents within RTS games. These methods were tested in a brand new RTS framework developed in Unreal Engine 5, utilising C++ for greater performance. This framework included both the core mechanics of an RTS game, but also a basic AI structured according to practices researched in the literature of this field. The methods researched were then implemented into the decision-making process of this basic AI. These were then tested against human participants to see from both data collected on match statistics, as well as participant opinion, on whether or not the AI they played was challenging. This paper found that methods such as dynamic difficulty scaling and the Lanchester combat prediction algorithm were deemed more challenging by participants and supporting data, rather than methods like allowing the AI to cheat.</p>
				<h2>Current Project Progress</h2>
                <p>As of the end of December, the literature review and research methodology sections of the dissertation are completed. The core mechanics of the prototype are finished, the only development left to complete is developing the AI system itself.</p>
