				<p class="para">I have always enjoyed playing video games since I was a little. But I started making them when I started secondary school. I started making simple games on scratch, but by the time I finished sixth form I had also learned Python, Visual Basic, Javascript and C#. This was because I taught myself the basics of Unity for my final year project in A level computer science; which was a 3D top down naval strategy game. That was also my first proper experience using a games engine.
I chose to study games design as during lockdown I started creating mods in Star Wars Battlefront 2, a favourite game of mine. When I started to earn some money from this, I realised maybe I could pursue game design at Univeristy and work on the games I enjoyed modding/playing.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="para">Now in my second year of studying Games Design and Programming, I have amassed quite a number of skills under my belt, and even took a 3D modelling module to improve my skills there. Something I wanted to learn since I started making battlefront 2 mods.
I have also now started to learn the basics of HTML and CSS with the help of my friend, in order to create this website and any other web design projects I may want to work on.

In the future I hope to learn more skills in order to help my career in the games industry, as well as be able to continue producing work for projects and games I enjoy.</p>
